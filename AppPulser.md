#App::Pulser
This is a simplified version of the Metronome originally deployed in the standard distribution of PineTime.

I have been trying to use the distributed Metronome however encountered several practical problems with the arc interface.
Additionally, the complexity of specifying the time signature was of little use as conductor.
To keep the screen simple to read, i designed the screen with four simple buttons, in clockwise order from top left to bottom left.
These are internally called Pulser 1, 2, 3 and 4.

- By clicking on a grey button, it gets activated and changes colour to green, and the app starts to vibrate at the specified beats per minute, and if another button was active, it becomes deactivated automatically.
- By clicking on a green button, it becomes deactivated and the vibration stop.

Here few examples:
